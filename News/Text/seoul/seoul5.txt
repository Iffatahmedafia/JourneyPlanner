South Korea’s Daelim Industrial said Thursday it has applied for a
patent for its new technology that drastically reduces sound between
apartment floors.
According to the construction company, it analyzed the impact patterns
of the footsteps of adults and children to develop the new method of
topping two layers of mortar and one layer of insulation material on
top of the concrete slab, which is the basic frame of a building.

Dubbed the Noise Free 3-layer System, the extra mortar and high-level
insulation materials filter out the din, and turn out to be more
effective in reducing sound than just using a 60-millimeter insulation
material, the company said.

In Korea where apartments are more popular than individual houses, the
floor impact sound caused by adult footsteps and when children run
often triggers disputes between neighbors.

Daelim said its technology passed the performance test conducted by
Housing Environment Research and Innovation, a research center under
Korea Land & Housing Corp.

“We were able to reduce the noise between floors with a new method
that has not been tried before,” a company official said.

“We are continuing our research to reduce noise inconvenience for
residents.”
