Snooker's lucrative China Open has been postponed over fears around
the coronavirus outbreak.

The ranking event in Beijing was due to take place from 30 March to 5
April, finishing 13 days before the World Championship starts at the
Crucible.

"Our priority has to be the welfare of players, staff and the many
fans who travel around China and beyond," said the World Snooker Tour
(WST).

Meanwhile, the LPGA Blue Bay golf event in China has been cancelled.

The women's competition was scheduled to begin on 5 March.

Two people from the same family have tested positive for coronavirus
in the UK, the chief medical officer for England announced on Friday.

At least 213 people in China have died from the virus, with almost
10,000 cases nationally. There have been a further 98 cases in another
18 countries.

The WST said: "Discussions with our partners in terms of staging this
event at a later date are ongoing. 

"In the meantime, our thoughts are with all of our many friends across
China and in particular those affected by the coronavirus."
