Taiwan Power Co (Taipower, 台電) yesterday restarted the No. 2
coal-fired generator at its Taichung Power Plant as energy consumption
across the nation hit a record high.

Citing rising temperatures as summer rolls around, Taipower said it
decided to activate the No. 2 generator to prepare for an upcoming
surge in energy consumption and help guarantee a steady supply of
electricity during exam season.

Taipower’s move provoked an outcry from the Taichung City
Government, which threatened the company with a maximum fine of NT$20
million (US$674,764) and to take it to court if it restarted the unit
without the city’s permission.

The No. 2 generator had been on standby since January due to rising
tensions between the state-run utility and the city government over
the issue of air pollution.

Environmentalists have said that the Taichung plant is one of the
world’s largest emitters of carbon dioxide.

After repeatedly fining the company, the city government last year
revoked its operating licenses for the No. 2 and No. 3 generators.

However, in February, the Environmental Protection Administration
countermanded the city government’s sanctions.

Taipower yesterday said that its generators conform to local emissions
standards, following improvements at the Taichung plant.

The company added that it would halt operations of the No. 1 generator
for annual repair and maintenance.
