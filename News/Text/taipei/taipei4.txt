The median income figure included base salaries, allowances, cash

million, and total compensation to global employees rose 1.6 percent
from NT$108.2 billion over the same period.

TSMC employed 51,297 people at the end of last year, of which 34,137
were managers, professionals and administrative staff, and the
remaining 17,160 were production line technicians, the report said.

More than 80 percent of TSMC’s managers and professionals had a
master’s degree or higher, the report showed.

About 90 percent of TSMC employees are based in Taiwan and the rest
are based overseas.

TSMC shares on Wednesday rose 0.79 percent to close at NT$317.5 in
Taipei trading. The stock this year has declined 7.4 percent, compared
