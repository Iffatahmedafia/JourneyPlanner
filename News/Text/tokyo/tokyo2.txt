IMF DOWNGRADES FORECAST FOR GLOBAL CONTRACTION TO 4.9% IN PANDEMIC |
THE JAPAN TIMES

Washington – The International Monetary Fund said Wednesday it
expects the global economy to decline 4.9 percent from the previous
year, raising its April estimate by 1.9 points to reflect the
worsening economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.

With the pandemic triggering the worst global recession since the
Great Depression in the 1930s, the IMF projected in an update to its
World Economic Outlook for 2020 that Japan’s economy will slump 5.8
percent, 0.6 point more than earlier forecast and sharper than in 2009
at the height of the global financial crisis.

The United States, one of the nations hardest hit by the virus first
detected in China late last year, will see its economy shrink 8.0
percent, 2.1 points more than the earlier estimate and its worst
contraction since 1946.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has had a more negative impact on activity in
the first half of 2020 than anticipated, and the recovery is projected
to be more gradual than previously forecast,” the IMF said in the
report.

First-quarter gross domestic product was generally worse than
expected, though countries like China, India and Japan were
exceptions. Economic indicators point to a more severe contraction in
the second quarter, except in China, where most of the country
reopened by early April, the IMF said.

Growth in consumption, in particular, was downgraded for most
economies as demand shock has been triggered by social distancing
measures and lockdowns to slow the virus, as well as by a rise in
precautionary savings.

Global activity is expected to trough in the second quarter, with
growth in 2021 projected to strengthen to 5.4 percent, 0.4 point lower
than the April estimate, according to the report.

Global trade in goods and services was also revised downward by 0.9
point to a contraction of 11.9 percent, reflecting considerably weaker
demand in areas including tourism. A gradual pickup in domestic demand
is expected to push trade growth up to 8.0 percent in 2021, the IMF
said.

Japan and the United States are expected to see their economies post
growth of 2.4 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively, in 2021, but
these estimates as well were lowered from the earlier estimates.

China’s economic growth forecast was revised downward by 0.2 point
to 1.0 percent for 2020, and by 1.0 point to 8.2 percent for 2021.

The euro area was forecast this year to log a contraction of 10.2
percent, down 2.7 points from April’s report. But the outlook for
the region was upgraded by 1.3 points to 6.0 percent growth for 2021.

Based on the latest projections, the cumulative output loss for the
global economy from the pandemic will be over $12 trillion across 2020
and 2021 , the Washington-based institution said, warning that
“pervasive uncertainty,” including the length of the pandemic,
will continue to haunt its latest forecast.
