JAPAN SEEKS CLOSURE IN POST-BREXIT U.K. TRADE TALKS BY END OF JULY |
THE JAPAN TIMES

Japan is aiming to conclude its current trade negotiations with the
U.K. by the end of next month, according to a Japanese government
official familiar with the talks.

While the time frame sounds very short for a trade negotiation, the
two sides aren’t starting from scratch because they already have an
economic partnership agreement, the official said.

Hiroshi Matsuura, Tokyo’s chief negotiator in the talks, earlier
told the Financial Times that his nation was giving the U.K. six weeks
to strike a post-Brexit trade deal so both sides needed to limit their
ambitions.

Japan wants to close the deal early as it will need time to check each
detail before it can be sent to the Diet for approval, according to
the government official. The Diet is expected to start an extra
session this autumn.

Securing trade deals is a top priority for the U.K. as it emerges into
a post-Brexit world. Without a new accord, the two countries will
default to trading on World Trade Organization terms.
